1.Before setting up the IP Lookup, make you sure you've "trimmed" your ladderlog(s):
  - go to scripts and open trim.php
  - modify $sources and $target
  - $sources can either be an array (more ladderlogs at once) or just a simple string (just one ladderlog)
  - $target is the name of your target file, whicht contains the trimmed ladderlog data

2.Next you have to go to web and open config.php and modify it your needs.

3.That's it! Your IP Lookup should be working fine now!
