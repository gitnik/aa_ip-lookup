1.Before setting up the IP Lookup, make you sure you've "trimmed" your ladderlog(s):
  - go to scripts and open trim.php
  - modify $sources and $target
  - $sources can contain more than one ladderlog, just add the paths to the array
  - $target is the name of your target file, which contains the trimmed ladderlog data

2.Next you have to go to web and open config.php and modify it your needs.

3.That's it! Your IP Lookup should be working fine now!
